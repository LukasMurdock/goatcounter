Commands:
help           Show help.
serve          Serve just one domain. This is probably what you want if you're
               looking to self-host GoatCounter. Requires creating a site with
               "create" first.
init           Create a new site and user; only needed for "serve".
migrate        Run database migrations.

Advanced commands:
dev            Run a development server.
saas           Run a "SaaS" production server.
reindex        Re-create the cached statistics (*_stats tables) from the hits.
               This is generally rarely needed and mostly a development tool.

See "help <command>" for more details for the command.`,
